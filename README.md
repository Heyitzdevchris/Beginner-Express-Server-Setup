# Beginner-Express-Server-Setup

This is a beginner setup of a working express server using nodemon that recieves & responds to a simple request. This server also contains an application middleware to configure the simple request coming in, or going out of the server.

## Starting Server

To get the server up and running on your local machine do the following:

- Fork & clone the repository
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Then run `npm run dev` to have nodemon start "watching" & run the server on local PORT:5001
- You can then open your brower and head to "localhost:5001" to view the servers output.
